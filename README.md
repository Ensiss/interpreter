interpreter
===========

A small interpreter built in nodejs.
Because why not ?

## How to launch

To interpret a source code file just pass it to main.js like this:
```shell
node main expr
```
If you made changes to the project and want to check if you didn't break everything in the process, just type:
```shell
node test
```
